  Cos I've been in love before, and I found that love was more than just holding hands

      If I give my heart to you I must be sure
           D Em F#m   Fm   Em7       A                 D    Gm  A  
  From the very start that you would love me more than her

      If I trust in you, oh please don't run and hide

Chorus
                           G         Gm7
  Cos I couldn't stand the pain, and I 
                          D           A
  Would be sad if our new love was in vain

           And that she will cry when she learns we are two

Chorus
                           G         Gm7
  Cos I couldn't stand the pain, and I

  Would be sad if our new love was in vain
