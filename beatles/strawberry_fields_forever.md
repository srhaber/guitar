Chorus
       (A)                                  Em
       Let me take you down cause I'm going to 
       Em         Em7     F#7
       Strawberry Fields, nothing is real
       D              F#         
   And nothing to get hung about
       D                 A
       Strawberry Fields forever
       
       
Verse       
       E         E^7       E7       Bm7/E  E  F#m     E                D
       Living is easy with eyes closed        misunderstanding all you see
       D            E              A          A/G#      F#m  F#m7
       It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
       D          E              D  A
       It doesn't matter much to me

Chorus

Verse
       E        E^7         E7   Bm7/E  E  F#m       E               D
       No one I think is in my tree        I mean it must be high or low
       D           E              A                A/G# F#m  F#m7
       That is you can't you know tune in but it's all  right
       D         E                  D   A
       That is I think it's not too bad

Chorus

Verse
       E      E^7      E7               Bm7/E  E  F#m            E                D
       Always know sometimes think it's me        but you know I know when it's a dream
       D          E                A             A/G# F#m  F#m7
       I think a "No" will mean a "Yes" but it's all  wrong
       D         E           D    A 
       That is I think I disagree

Chorus
       (A)                                  Em
       Let me take you down cause I'm going to 
       Em         Em7     F#7
       Strawberry Fields, nothing is real
       D              F#         
   And nothing to get hung about
       D                 A       F#m7
       Strawberry Fields forever
       D                 A     
       Strawberry Fields forever      
       D          E      D    
       Strawberry Fields forever
