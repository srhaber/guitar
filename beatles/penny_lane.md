# Penny Lane - The Beatles

```
Verse
                 B          B/A#  G#m    G#m7    E       C#m7  F#    
        In Penny Lane there is a  barber showing photographs
                 B         B/A#    G#m      G#m7    Bm7   
        Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
                 Bm6/G#               G^7         F#sus4  F#  F#sus4  F#
     And all the people that come and go stop and say hello
   
                 B      B/A# G#m    G#m7   E    C#m7 F#
          On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
                 B        B/A#     G#m   G#m7     Bm7
      The little children laugh at him behind his back
                 Bm6/G#               G^7        F#sus4    F#  E
         And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain, very strange

Chorus
                 A             A/C#           D
           Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
                 A                 A/C#          D                F#
                 There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back

Verse
                 B          B/A#  G#m     G#m7    E     C#m7  F# 
        In Penny Lane there is a  fireman with an hourglass
                 B      B/A# G#m      G#m7   Bm7  
      And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
                 Bm6/G#               G^7           F#sus4     F#  F#sus4  F#
     He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine

Solo

                 B   B/A#  G#m  G#m7  E  C#m7  F#
                 B   B/A#  G#m  G#m7  Bm7
                 Bm6/G#    G^7        F#sus4   F#   E

Chorus
                 A             A/C#           D
           Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
                 A         A/C#            D               F#
                 A four of fish and finger pies in summer, meanwhile back

Verse
                 B       B/A#   G#m    G#m7 E      C#m7  F#
      Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
                 B        B/A#    G#m     G#m7   Bm7
      The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
                 Bm6/G#                 G^7          F#sus4  F# F#sus4 F#
  And though she feels as if she's in a play, she is anyway

                 B        B/A#   G#m     G#m7   E    C#m7  F#
        In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
                 B      B/A#    G#m     G#m7  Bm7
      We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
                 Bm6/G#         G^7         F#sus4    F#  E
    And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain, very strange

Chorus
                 A             A/C#           D
           Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
                 A                 A/C#          D                F#
                 There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back

Outro
                 B             B/D#           E
           Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
                 B                 B/D#          E
                 There beneath the blue suburban skies
                 B
       Penny Lane
