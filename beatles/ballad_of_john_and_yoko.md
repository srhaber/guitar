                  E                  
                  Standing in the dock at Southampton
                  Trying to get to Holland or France
                  E7
              The man in the mac said 
           You've got to go back,
    You know they didn't even give us a chance

                            A                              E
  Christ, you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be 
                            B7                              E
         The way things are going, they're going to crucify me

Verse
                  E
                  Finally made the plane into Paris
                  Honeymooning down by the Seine
                  E7
            Peter Brown call to say
          You can make it O.K.
      You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain

         The way things are going, they're going to crucify me

Verse
                  E
       Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
                  Talking in our beds for a week
                  E7
              The newspapers said
  Say what're you doing in bed?
     I said we're only trying to get us some peace

Chorus
                            A                              E

                            B7                              E
         The way things are going, they're going to crucify me

Bridge
                  A
                  Saving up your money for a rainy day
                  Giving all your clothes to charity
                  Last night the wife said
                  Oh boy when you're dead
                  B7
              You don't take nothing with you but your soul, think

Verse
                  E
                  Made a lightning trip to Vienna
                  Eating chocolate cake in a bag
                  E7
              The newspapers said
            She's gone to his head
             They look just like two gurus in drag

Chorus
                            A                              E
  Christ, you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be 
                            B7                              E
         The way things are going, they're going to crucify me

Verse
                  E
                  Caught the early plane back to London
                  Fifty acorns tied in a sack
                  E7
              The men from the press
          Said we wish you success
             It's good to have the both of you back

Chorus
                            A                              E
  Christ, you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be 
                            B7                              E
         The way things are going, they're going to crucify me
                            B7                              E
         The way things are going, they're going to crucify me
