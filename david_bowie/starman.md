# Starman - David Bowie

```
Intro
            Bb^7     F^7     (2x)
      
Verse
            Gm                                                   F
            Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low-oh-oh 
            F                           C
            I leaned back on my radio-o-o
            C                             C7                                  F   Ab  Bb
            Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, 'lotta soul he said

            Gm                                   F
            Then the loud sound did seem to fa-a-ade
            F                                              C
            Came back like a slow voice on a wave of pha-a-ase
            C                              C7                A     Gadd9
            That weren't no D.J., that was hazy cosmic jive

Chorus
            F       Dm                 
  There's a starman waiting in the sky
            Am               Am7/G           C
       He'd like to come and meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds
            F       Dm
  There's a starman waiting in the sky
            Am             Am7/G             C                   C7
       He's told us not to blow it, cause he knows it's all worthwhile, he told me
            Bb      Bbm               F       D7
            Let the children lose it, let the children use it
            Gm          C
            Let all the children boogie

Bridge
            Bb    F    C    F
            Bb    F    C

Verse
            Gm                                           F
            I had to phone someone, so I picked on you-u-u
            F                                          C
            Hey, that's far out so you heard him too-o-oo
            C                        C7                     F    Ab  Bb   
            Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two

            Gm                                       F
            Look out your window, I can see his li-i-ight
            F                                    C
            If we can sparkle he may land toni-i-ight
            C                              C7                          A     Gadd9
            Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

Chorus (2x)
            F       Dm                 
  There's a starman waiting in the sky
            Am               Am7/G           C
       He'd like to come and meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds
            F       Dm
  There's a starman waiting in the sky
            Am             Am7/G             C                   C7
       He's told us not to blow it, cause he knows it's all worthwhile, he told me
            Bb      Bbm               F       D7
            Let the children lose it, let the children use it
            Gm          C
            Let all the children boogie
