  Is there anybody going to listen to my story

           All about the girl who came to stay?
           Cm               G7              Cm 
 She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry

           Still you don't regret a single day

    When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her
           Fm                               Eb    G7
           She will turn to me and start to cry
           Cm           G7              Cm        Cm7
   And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
           Fm                               Cm
           After all this time I don't know why

           She's the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there, you feel a fool
           Fm                                   Cm
           When you say she's looking good, she acts as if it's understood

           Cm                G7                    Cm      Cm7
   Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure
           Fm                              Eb    G7
           Did she understand it when they said
           Cm                 G7               Cm     Cm7
    That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
           Fm                                  Cm
           Will she still believe it when he's dead

Chorus
