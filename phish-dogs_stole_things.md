Verse
      A          C                 G  D    Dm          A      
      Dogs stole things I needed bad, cats took what I never had
      A           C            G  D          Dm        A
      Pillows for my aching head, a glass of milk next to my bed

Chorus
      E                  E6    E7      E6  E             E6      A
      The creatures that seem, oh so kind, and sleep all day and ease your mind
      E             E6     E7     E6  A                        C        D
      At night they softly paddle on, and look to steal things that you own
      
Verse 2    
      A               C       G      D          Dm        A
      So now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord that I might keep
      A                    C        G    D            Dm        A
      My soul for one more night or two, and hope the creatures never do

Chorus
      E                  E6    E7      E6  E             E6      A
      The creatures that seem, oh so kind, and sleep all day and ease your mind
      E             E6     E7     E6  A                        C        D
      At night they softly paddle on, and look to steal things that you own
