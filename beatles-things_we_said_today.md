Intro
       Am   Am7/E  (repeat)

Verse
       Am     Am7/E     Am   Am7/E Am   Am7/E   Am   Am7/E
       You say you will love me    if I have to go
       Am        Am7/E    Am Am7/E Am      Am7/E  Am
       You'll be thinking of me    somehow I will know
       C                C7     F                      Bb
       Someday when I'm lonely wishing you weren't so far away
       Am     Am7/E  Am   Am7/E Am        Am7/E  Am 
       Then I will remember     things we said today

       Am      Am7/E     Am      Am7/E Am       Am7/E  Am   Am7/E  
       You say you'll be mine, girl,   till the end of time
       Am         Am7/E  Am     Am7/E Am       Am7/E   Am  
       These days such a kind girl    seems so hard to find
       C                  C7        F                   Bb
       Someday when we're dreaming, deep in love, not a lot to say
       Am      Am7/E  Am   Am7/E Am        Am7/E  A
       Then we will remember     things we said today

Chorus
       A                D           B                E                A
       Me, I'm just the lucky kind, love to hear you say that love is luck
       A              D            B               Bb               Am
       And though we may be blind, love is here to stay and that's enough

Verse
       Am Am7/E    Am      Am7/E Am     Am7/E Am  Am7/E
       To make you mine, girl,   be the only one
       Am      Am7/E   Am      Am7/E Am       Am7/E  Am
       Love me all the time, girl,   we'll go on and on 
       C                  C7        F                   Bb
       Someday when we're dreaming, deep in love, not a lot to say
       Am      Am7/E  Am   Am7/E Am        Am7/E  A
       Then we will remember     things we said today

       Me, I'm just the lucky kind, love to hear you say that love is luck
       A              D            B               Bb               Am
       And though we may be blind, love is here to stay and that's enough
