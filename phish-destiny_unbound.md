           Highway Bill's on the rotary still and he can't even feel the pain

      Of a sun dried shoulder and a scar from a boulder that cut him right across his vein

  Now he's suckin' cigar and he's shovelin' tar in the crater of a turnpike terrain
           F#                    B                    E               B             F#

           Highway Jill was a daffodil with a cactus sense of pride
           F#                          G#                         C#
    At the wheel of a tractor, she was quite an impactor when the road rocks started to slide
           F#                        B                    E                        F#    
   She saw Bill drop his shovel on a pile of gravel as he climbed up out of his ditch
           F#                   B                             E                     B           F#             
   She was wonderstruck when he climbed in her truck he said "I've been havin' this everlasting itch

Chorus
           E                   B     F#            B
           We gotta get on the road, destiny unbound
           E                   B  C#                 F#    
           You're the one for me, we gotta get outta town (2x)

Jam
           F#

Bridge
           E                              B                   F#                      B
           At first she was cold, she was ready to scold this guy from the pit with a thing in his head
           E                                  B                        C#                      A        
           But then she thought twice when he melted her ice, with his passionate eyes she was energized

Verse
           F#                       B                      C#                       F#                 
       She started the ignition and without permission the two of 'em flew down the dusty road
           F#                           B 
   But the road wasn't finished and the pavement diminished 
           E                            B                  
      They soared off the edge and they plunged in the sludge

Chorus
                
  (She said) 
           E                 B      F#              B
     There isn't even any road, our destiny was bound
           E                     B      C#               F#    
           We were the ones for us, but now we're in the ground (2x)
