# In My Life - The Beatles (Lennon/McCartney)

```
Intro
            A    E (2x)
        
Verse        
            A      E      F#m  A7/G      D Dm         A
  There are places I remember     all my life, though some have changed
            A    E       F#m   A7/G         D Dm     A
    Some forever not for better,  some have gone and some remain
            F#m              D            G                    A
  All these places had their moments with lovers and friends I still can recall
            F#m               B          Dm7          A               E
   Some are dead and some are living, in my life I've loved them all

Verse
            A         E           F#m   A7/G         D  Dm     A           
     But of all these friends and lovers,   there is no one compares with you
            A        E          F#m    A7/G       D        Dm      A
  And these memories lose their meaning    when I think of love as something new
            F#m                    D           G                      A
   Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before
            F#m                             B             Dm7       A
          I know I'll often stop and think about them, in my life I love you more

   Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before
            F#m                             B             Dm7       A              E
