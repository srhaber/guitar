       I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
       A            C#m F#m        C#m          Bm                   E

     I look at the world and I notice it's turning, while my guitar gently weeps

  With every mistake we must surely be learning, still my guitar gently weeps

       A            C#m F#m        C#m     Bm                 E
       I don't know how you were diverted, you were perverted too
       A            C#m F#m        C#m     Bm             E      
       I don't know how you were inverted, no one alerted you
