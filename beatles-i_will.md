# I Will - The Beatles

```
Verse 
          F         Dm        Gm7       C7
      Who knows how long I've loved you   
          F      Dm       Am    F7
      You know I love you still
          Bb     C      F       
   Will I wait a lonely lifetime
          Bb      C     F    Dm  Gm7  C7
   If you want me to, I will
 
 
          F    Dm   Gm7     C7
      For if I ever saw you
          F      Dm         Am   F7
        I didn't catch your name
          Bb    C      F
   But it never really mattered
          Bb     C        F    F7
   I will always feel the same

     Your song will fill the air

  Make it easy to be near you
